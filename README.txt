This iPhone application provides a Flickr photo viewing experience. It gets the top places from Flickr and photos from those places and displays them.  It loads in a separate thread so the UI does not freeze.  The images can zoom and scroll.  You can also view an annotated map of the places, or of the photos in a place. For annotations representing a photo you can click the “i” in the callout to display the photo.  The other tab shows a list of your recently viewed photos stored in User Defaults.  The app caches loaded photos up to 10 MB in a file.

This project was created by Andrea Houg, following the iTunes University version of Standford’s CS 193P course.  The FlickrFetcher classes were provided on the course website.  

This app has only been tested by running the project in Xcode 5.
